<h3>California is leading America and the world on clean energy</h3>



<p>Over the past 10 years, California has established itself as a prominent leader in adopting and implementing ambitious clean energy policies. California matters – economically and environmentally – not only in the American but in the global context. If California were a country, it would be the world’s 5th largest economy, bigger than the UK, France, or India.</p>
<p>The recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/renewables-portfolio-standard">Renewables Portfolio Standard</a>&nbsp;implemented in 2018 requires that 50% of California's electricity come from&nbsp;zero-carbon sources&nbsp;by 2025, 60% by 2025, and 100% by 2045. The cumulative result of these bold policies and unprecedented private investment is encouraging. Over the last decade, California was able to steadily reduce the physical volumes of fossil fuel-derived generation by about 25% while growing the economy by 40%.</p>
